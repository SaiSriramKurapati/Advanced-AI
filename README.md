## Contents:
- Advanced_AI_Search_Algorithms.pdf: A detailed document explaining the implementation of various search algorithms.
- search.py: Python script implementing basic search structures.
- searchAgents.py: Python script with agent-based implementations of search algorithms.

## Implementation Details:
- The repository covers several search algorithms:

    - Depth First Search (DFS)
    - Breadth First Search (BFS)
    - Uniform Cost Search (UCS)
    - A* Search
- Each algorithm is detailed in the PDF and implemented in the Python scripts.

## Usage Instructions:
- To use the scripts, clone the repository and run the Python files. Make sure to refer to the PDF document for detailed explanations of the algorithms and their use cases.

## Requirements:
- Python 3.x
